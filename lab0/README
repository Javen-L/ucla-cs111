1. lab0.c
This is a source file for the program. It has a simple functionality,
namely to copy the content of stdin to stdout. In addition to that, you could
use options to cause a segmentation fault and to catch the segmentation fault.
The basic usage is as follows:
usage: ./lab0 [OPTIONS...] 	
--input=filename    use the specified file as standard input 
--output=filename   use the specified file as standard output 
--segfault          force a segmentation fault 
--catch             use signal(2) to register a SIGSEGV handler

2. Makefile
This makefile is to build the program, to make a submission tarball,
and to perform a smoke testing. It has following targets:

lab0:	to build an executable from lab0.c (this is the default target)
clean:	to clean up the working directory, it remove lab0 and lab0-405118629.tar.gz
dist:	to make a submission tarball
check:	to perform a sanity check by using 9 sub-targets check1, ..., check9 
check1:	to test functionality of '--input -> --output'
check2:	to test functionality of '--input -> stdout'
check3: to test functionality of 'stdin -> stdout'
check4: to test functionality of 'stdin -> --output'
check5: to test functionality of handling a missing argument for --input option
check6: to test functionality of handling an invalid option
check7: to test functionality of handling an invalid input file
check8: to test functionality of handling an invalid output file
check9: to test functionality of handling --segfault and --catch options
