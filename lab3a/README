### DELIVERABLES
The submission tarball contains the required 4 files:

1. Makefile
    It has 3 targets:
    'default' is used to build executable lab3a from lab3a.c.
    'dist' is used to create a submission tarball.
    'clean' is to used to remove all the files created by Makefile.
    
2. README
    This file.

3. lab3a.c
    A source code for the program. In lab3a.c, main() is a wrapper
    function that calls other functions to write summary on stdout
    of superblock, group discriptor, free block entries, free inode
    entries, and inode. Each function is named in a selfexplanatory way.
    Note: read_inode_table() write inode summary on stdout as well as
    directory entries and indirect block references. To produce
    directory entries and indirect block references, recursive fundtions
    are used.

4. ext2_fs
    A provided header file.
