### DELIVERABLES
The submission tarball contains the required 4 files:

1. Makefile
    It has 4 targets: default, check, dist, and clean.
    'default' is used to build executable lab4b from lab4b.c.
    'check' is used to do a quick smoke test using smoke_test.sh.
    'dist' is used to create a submission tarball.
    'clean' is used to remove files generated by Makefile
    
2. README
    This file.

3. lab4b.c
    A source code for the program. It used two threads; one for stdin command
    processing and the other for sensor input processing. These two threads
    share 4 variables that keep tracks on period, scale, start/stop,
    and shutdown. However, period, scale and start/stop variables are not
    modified in sensor thread, therefore corresponding critical sections 
    are not locked. Shutdown flag can be modified by both threads. However,
    since using a lock for shutdown does not really give us much benefit, 
    I decided not to use any lock. This is because shutdown variable can be
    changed from 0 to 1 only once by each thread, and if one of the threads
    does change its value, the program terminates. 

4. smoke_test.sh
    A script for a simple smoke check used by 'make check' command.
