### DELIVERABLES
The submission tarball contains the required 4 files:

1. Makefile
    It has 3 targets: default, dist, and clean.
    'default' is used to build executables lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls.
    'dist' is used to create a submission tarball.
    'clean' is used to remove files generated by Makefile
    
2. README
    This file.

3, 4. lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c
    Source codes. Both program takes 4 mandatory parameters --id, --host,
    --log, and port number. I fist implemented lab4c_tcp.c by reusing my
    code from lab4b and lab1b. As my TA suggested, create_socket() is basically
    the same as what's given in the tutorial at
    https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/client.c.
    For lab4c_tls.c, I modified lab4c_tcp.c so that it uses TLS session.
    I used SSL related methods given in the discussion slide, and
    simply arranged them in the right order.
